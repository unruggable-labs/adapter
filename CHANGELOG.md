# Changelog

All notable changes to the Adapter8004 contract are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the contract aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
via the `@custom:version` tag in [`src/Adapter8004.sol`](./src/Adapter8004.sol).

Formal `@custom:version` numbering began at `0.0.6`. Earlier upgrades were
tracked by dated deployment reports in [`deployments/`](./deployments) and are
listed under "Earlier history" below by deployment date.

The adapter is a Safe-owned UUPS proxy. A source version is not live until its
implementation is deployed and the proxy is upgraded via the multisig. Confirm
the live implementation on a block explorer before relying on a version.

**Currently live on-chain (verified 2026-05-23, per-chain — they differ):**

- **Sepolia** (`0x7621…`): the **delegate.xyz v2** implementation
  (`0x31a68E5b…`). Proxy was upgraded, so delegate.xyz support is live here.
- **Base** (`0x270d…`): the **2026-05-15 counterfactual** implementation
  (`0x0f81bd4E…`). delegate.xyz is NOT live (its impl was deployed but the proxy
  was not upgraded).
- **Mainnet** (`0xde15…`): the counterfactual implementation
  (`0xa6D23f27…`). delegate.xyz is NOT live (its impl was never deployed here).

`0.0.6` and `0.0.7` are not live on any chain. Re-verify the EIP-1967
implementation slot on a block explorer before relying on this.

## [0.0.7] - Unreleased

Source version. Not deployed. Requires a fresh security review and audit pass
before any multisig deploy.

### Added
- `counterfactualRegisterWithSig`: signature-authorized counterfactual
  registration for ERC-721-, ERC-1155-, ERC-6909-, ERC-1155F-, and
  ERC-6909F-bound agents. The token owner signs one EIP-712
  payload (`agentURI` + full `metadata` + optional `agentWallet` + bounded
  `expiration`) and any caller (an NFT mint function, router, or relayer) can
  submit it, so a counterfactual registration can be folded into a mint
  transaction. Emits the existing `CounterfactualAgentRegistered` (and
  `CounterfactualAgentWalletSet` when a wallet is included) with
  `emitter = owner`. Owner-only signer (`ownerOf(tokenId)`), `MAX_EXPIRATION_DELAY`
  of 30 minutes, no nonce, no new storage (stateless EIP-712 domain). Solves the
  register-at-mint problem; updates afterward use the existing controller-gated
  unsigned setters. See [`docs/proposals/counterfactual-register-with-sig.md`](./docs/proposals/counterfactual-register-with-sig.md).
- Token standard enum values `ERC1155F` (`0x03`) and `ERC6909F` (`0x04`) for
  non-fungible ERC-1155/ERC-6909 tokens that expose `ownerOf(uint256)` per the
  profile proposed in Ethereum/ERCs PR #1767. These standards use single-owner
  control (`ownerOf` plus delegate.xyz on unsigned/controller-gated paths);
  plain ERC-1155/ERC-6909 remain balance-based.
- Errors: `ExpirationTooFar`, `SignatureExpired`, `InvalidSignature`.

## [0.0.6] - Unreleased

Source version. Safe TX payloads prepared 2026-05-20
([`deployments/`](./deployments)) but not yet executed.

### Added
- `bindExisting`: pull an already-minted ERC-8004 `agentId` into adapter
  management against an external ERC-721/1155/6909 token, using a
  two-transaction approval model. Preserves the existing `agentURI` and
  non-binding metadata; overwrites only the reserved `agent-binding` key.
- Counterfactual payload versioning: every counterfactual event carries a
  `uint8 version` first non-indexed field (baseline `1`), so indexers can detect
  ABI cutovers.
- Reserved `cf-registration` metadata key on the counterfactual write surface,
  preventing a fabricated promotion back-link before any on-chain mint.

### Changed
- `registrationHash` now binds the token `standard` in addition to chain id,
  adapter address, token contract, and token id.

### Errors
- `AlreadyBound`, `NotAgentOwner`, `AgentTransferNotApproved`,
  `InvalidTokenContractIsRegistry`.

## Earlier history (pre-version-numbering)

These upgrades predate the `@custom:version` tag and were tracked by dated
deployment reports in [`deployments/`](./deployments). Dates are deployment or
report dates, not source-tag dates.

### 2026-05-16 — delegate.xyz v2 ERC-721 delegate support (live on Sepolia only)
- Adds hot/cold control for ERC-721 bindings: a wallet holding a delegate.xyz v2
  delegation from the current owner can drive the agent while the NFT stays in
  cold storage. Fails closed to direct ownership if the registry has no code.
- **Per-chain status (verified 2026-05-23):**
  - **Sepolia: live.** Implementation `0x31a68E5b…` deployed, and the proxy was
    upgraded to it. delegate.xyz support is active here.
  - **Base: not live.** Implementation `0x0e30C112…` was deployed and verified,
    but the proxy was not upgraded (still on the 2026-05-15 counterfactual impl
    `0x0f81bd4E…`).
  - **Mainnet: not live.** Implementation never deployed (the deploy was deferred
    for gas; the proxy still runs `0xa6D23f27…`).
- The 2026-05-16 deployment report records the implementation deploys; the
  Sepolia proxy upgrade was performed afterward. Safe TX payloads
  (`deployments/2026-05-16-delegate-xyz-safe-tx-*.json`) were prepared for the
  Base/mainnet upgrades but not executed. See
  `deployments/2026-05-16-delegate-xyz-implementation-deployment-report.md`.

### 2026-05-15 — ownership transferred to Safe multisig
- Adapter `owner()` moved from the deployer EOA to a Safe v1.4.1 multisig at the
  same address (`0x03302Df40186D9B85faEA4fbb6cC5da028B23149`) on Mainnet, Base,
  and Sepolia. The transfer report records a threshold of 2 at transfer time; the
  Safe config has since evolved. Current on-chain config (verified 2026-05-23):
  **Mainnet 3-of-4**, **Base 2-of-4**, **Sepolia 2-of-4**. See
  `deployments/2026-05-15-ownership-transfer-to-safe-report.md`, and confirm the
  live threshold/owners on-chain before relying on it. Any 0.0.6 / 0.0.7 deploy on
  mainnet now needs 3 of 4 signatures.

### 2026-05-15 — counterfactual registration family + full event coverage + reentrancy guards (current live implementation)
- Emit-only counterfactual register family (`counterfactualRegister` plus five
  `counterfactual*` setters): mirrors the on-chain register surface but emits
  events only, keyed by `registrationHash(chainid, adapter, tokenContract, tokenId)`
  (the `standard` field was added later in 0.0.6).
- Full on-chain event coverage: every state-mutating external function emits one
  adapter-level event (`AgentURISet`, `MetadataSet`, `AgentWalletSet`,
  `AgentWalletUnset`, `BindingMetadataRewritten`, alongside the existing
  `AgentBound`, `MetadataBatchSet`, `IdentityRegistryUpdated`).
- OZ v5 `ReentrancyGuard` (ERC-7201 namespaced) on every state-mutating external
  function. Rolled out to all three proxies via executed `upgradeToAndCall`. See
  `deployments/2026-05-15-counterfactual-upgrade-report.md`.

### 2026-05-07 — ERC-8004 interface coverage upgrade
- Aligned the adapter with the full ERC-8004 interface surface: direct view
  forwarders `getMetadata` / `getAgentWallet` / `ownerOf` / `tokenURI`
  (`IERC8004IdentityRecord`), the `register(string)` / `register()` overloads, the
  read/registration interface split, and a
  `register(standard, tokenContract, tokenId, agentURI)` convenience overload.
  No new storage. See `deployments/2026-05-07-erc8004-coverage-upgrade-report.md`.

### 2026-04-30 — ERC-8217 binding-metadata migration
- The `agent-binding` metadata value became the 20-byte binding-contract
  (adapter) address, with token coordinates read from `bindingOf(agentId)`. See
  `deployments/2026-04-30-erc8217-upgrade-report.md` and
  `deployments/2026-04-30-erc8217-migration-plan.md`.

### 2026-04-05 — initial deployment (Mainnet, Base, Sepolia)
- First Adapter8004 release: `register`, `setAgentURI`, `setMetadata`,
  `setMetadataBatch`, `setAgentWallet`, `unsetAgentWallet`, `bindingOf`,
  `isController`, over an `ERC1967Proxy` with a UUPS upgradeable implementation.
  See `deployments/2026-04-05-deployment-report.md`.
